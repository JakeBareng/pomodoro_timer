# pomodoro timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves dividing work into timed intervals, called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks. After four pomodoros, a longer break is taken. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and reduce stress. The Pomodoro Technique can be used for various tasks, from work-related projects to personal errands.
